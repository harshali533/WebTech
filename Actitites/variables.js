--variable declaraion
let-once declared value can be redeclared-->used currently.It is block scope variable
const-once declared value cannot be redeclared again
var-same as let but used by earlier developer.It is not block scope variable

Datatypes - 

1.Primitive                                                  2.Non-primitive
number,string,boolean,undefine,null,bigint,symbol              object


Q.What is difference betn let,const and var?
Q.What "    "         "   (==) and (===)?

== ->check only condition
=== ->check condition as well as datatype


scope-In {} curly braces if we declare any variable then it is accessiable in that block only.

Limitation of using var-->When we use var in scope and then print it outside the scope then it take value in scope the the
value outside scope we declared.


Difference between null and undefined.
--> null is the absence of a value
--> A variable has been declared but not assigned a value
