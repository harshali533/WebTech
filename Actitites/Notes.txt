scope-In {} curly braces if we declare any variable then it is accessiable in that block only.

Limitation of using var-->When we use var in scope and then print it outside the scope then it take value in scope the the
value outside scope we declared.

*Conversion operator
We can convert one datatype to another.
To convert num to string use - String()
"    "     string to number - Number()
"    "     boolean to number - Number()
"    "     number to boolean - Boolean()
"    "     boolean to string - String()
"    "     string to boolean - Boolean()

*Arithmetic operators
+, - , * , /, %

To concat strings we use + operator

IMP-when one is string with number and other is number and when we try it to add using + operator then we get 
one string with number.The number is concat with the string
console.log("1" + 2) --> 12

console.log(1+2 + "2") --> 32
This show 1st it add numbers from left and then concat with sring

console.log(true) --> true
console.log(+true) --> 1  --> + operator convert the boolean to number
console.log(+ "") --> 0  --> same as above


*Logical operator
< , > , == , != , <= , >=
